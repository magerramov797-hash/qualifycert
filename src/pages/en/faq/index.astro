  {
    q: "How long does ISO certification preparation take?",
    a: "The timeline depends on the standard, company size, and current readiness level. Typically: express preparation takes 2–4 weeks, while full implementation takes 1–3 months or more. We start with a diagnostic assessment and provide a realistic plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you issue the certificate or only prepare the company?",
    a: "We prepare the company: management system, documentation, training, internal audit, and readiness. The certificate itself is issued by an accredited certification body (CB). We can assist with CB selection and certification audit support.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which standards do you work with?",
    a: "Most commonly: ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 22000, and HACCP. We also implement integrated management systems (ISO 9001 + 14001 + 45001).",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the project start?",
    a: "With a brief information review and diagnostic (gap analysis): processes, risks, standard requirements, and existing documentation. Then we prepare a clear plan with stages, timelines, responsibilities, and document lists.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does ISO implementation cost?",
    a: "The cost depends on the industry, number of employees/sites, selected standards, and readiness level. To calculate accurately, we need basic input data. We provide a commercial proposal.",
  },
  {
    q: "What will we receive at the end of the project?",
    a: "A project plan, tailored documentation package, staff training, internal audit, CAPA plan, and improvement recommendations — all in a practical, usable format.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you conduct internal audits?",
    a: "Yes. We conduct ISO internal audits, pre-certification gap analyses, and supplier audits if required. You receive a report, nonconformities, and corrective action plans.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it possible to take training only?",
    a: "Yes. We provide training for management, ISO responsible persons, internal auditors, and staff. Format includes theory, practice, checklists, and document samples.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we need to implement several standards at once?",
    a: "Not always. Often, integrating ISO 9001 + 14001 + 45001 is beneficial as it reduces duplication and simplifies management. The decision depends on company goals.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you prepare for a certification audit?",
    a: "We conduct an internal audit, review records, prepare staff for interviews, close nonconformities through CAPA, and perform a final readiness check.",
  },
